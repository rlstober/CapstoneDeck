## Teaching Tool

## 

<h3> Features </h3>

1. Displays Histogram of T distribution
2. Allows user to alter degrees of freedom and number of observations.
3. Displays normal curve overlay to help visualize difference between the two distributions.

## Introductory Statistics

<h3> Benefits </h3>

1. Shows how degrees of freedom effects a t-distribution
2. Shows how number of observations effect both t-distribution and normal curve.
3. Shows differences between Normal and T distributions.

## Example Output

```{r exPlot2, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
#generate t-distribution
    set.seed(112358)
    df<-30
    no<-30
    tdist<-rt(df,no)

    tsd<-sd(tdist)
    tmn<-mean(tdist)
#plot histogram
    h<-hist(tdist, col = 'gray', border = 'white', main="T-distribution with Normal Overlay", xlab="Standard Deviation")
    
    #calculate normal distribution based on T distribution 
    ##xfit is a horizontal line with 50 points, running the range of the histogram
    xfit<-seq(min(tdist),max(tdist),length=50) 
    
    # apply normal density function to xfit
    # with a mean and standard deviation of the random T distribution
    yfit<-dnorm(xfit,mean=tmn,sd=tsd) 
    
    ## diff(h$mids[1:2]) is the distance between the midpoints 
    # of two bars of the histogram
    yfit <- yfit*diff(h$mids[1:2])*length(tdist) 
    
    # plot normal curve
    lines(xfit, yfit, col="red", lwd=2)
```
